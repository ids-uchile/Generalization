> Randomization tests. At the heart of our methodology is a variant of the well-known randomiza-
tion test from non-parametric statistics (Edgington & Onghena, 2007). In a first set of experiments,
we train several standard architectures on a copy of the data where the true labels were replaced by
random labels. Our central finding can be summarized as:
**Deep neural networks easily fit random labels.**
